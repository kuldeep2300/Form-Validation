#Form Validation Project with jQuery

It ensures that users enter correct details for email, mobile number, and password fields. If there are any mistakes, error messages are displayed accordingly. Upon successful validation, a registration success message appears. Additionally, the project includes password validation between the password and confirm password fields, providing a comprehensive validation experience.
